James Kruth's Emacs Config
==========================

I created this project after I realized two things:

* I had half a dozen disparate Emacs configs hanging around.
* Configuring your editor is a lot like creating your own lightsaber
  in the Star Wars movies - a rite of passage.
  
So here's my attempt to make a sane, maintainable Emacs config for use
across all my various systems.  This should work in most modern
versions of Emacs, but I'm only testing with Emacs 23.3 at the moment.

To Do
-----

* Decide on some licensing
* Add some stuff to this list - or use github issues.
* Maybe combine my emacs cheatsheet?
* Integrate ELPA/Marmalade (or upgrade to Emacs 24)
* Get some decent git integration - probably magit
